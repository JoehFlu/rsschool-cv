## About Me ##
I'm 27 years old, a former freelance outsourcer who started learning frontend development in 2017 thanks to a friend of mine who showed me how to change a page in real time using Chrome-DevTools. I immediately remembered the first releases of Mozilla Firefox and Chrome, when it became possible to put custom themes in the browser, and I knew I had fallen in love. Within six months, I was learning HTML, CSS, and JS on my own with the help of publicly available materials. After a while, I started making single-page adaptive websites for friends and acquaintances using Gulp and Jquery, but soon realized that it was a dead end and I needed to learn more about building websites with modern technology.
In 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I enrolled in a course with a mentor and began to learn the already modern standards of website development in JS6+, React.
But life took a slightly different turn and I had to start a career as a systems administrator.
At the moment I want to refresh my knowledge and practical skills to start working in a full-fledged Frontend developer position.
